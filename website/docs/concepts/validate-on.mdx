# Validation Modes (`validateOn`)

Formora makes validation behavior **explicit** by requiring you to choose _when_ validation runs.

This avoids hidden rules and unpredictable UX.

---

## The three modes

Formora supports exactly three validation modes:

- **`submit`** – validate only when the form is submitted
- **`change`** – validate on every value change
- **`blur`** – validate when a field loses focus

You choose one mode per form using the `validateOn` option.

```ts
const form = useForm({
  validateOn: "blur",
});
```

---

## `submit` mode

### When to use it

Use `submit` when:

- forms are simple
- you want minimal interruption
- errors should appear only after user intent

### Behavior

- No validation while typing
- Errors appear only after submit
- Errors stay visible until fixed or reset

```tsx
const form = useForm({ validateOn: "submit" });
```

:::info
This mode matches traditional HTML form behavior.
:::

---

## `change` mode

### When to use it

Use `change` when:

- you want instant feedback
- fields have strict formatting rules
- errors should never lag behind input

### Behavior

- Validation runs on every change
- Errors appear immediately
- Best combined with lightweight rules

```tsx
const form = useForm({ validateOn: "change" });
```

:::warning
Avoid expensive async validation in `change` mode unless debounced.
:::

---

## `blur` mode (recommended)

### When to use it

Use `blur` when:

- you want the best UX balance
- users should finish typing before seeing errors
- forms are non-trivial

### Behavior

- Validation runs when a field loses focus
- Errors appear after user finishes editing
- Errors stay visible until fixed

```tsx
const form = useForm({ validateOn: "blur" });
```

:::tip
This is the default recommendation for most production forms.
:::

---

## Error visibility vs validation

Validation **determines errors**.

Error visibility is controlled separately using:

```ts
form.shouldShowError(name);
```

This separation allows consistent UX across all modes.

---

## Comparison

| Mode   | When validation runs | UX style |
| ------ | -------------------- | -------- |
| submit | On submit only       | Calm     |
| change | On every change      | Instant  |
| blur   | On blur              | Balanced |

---

## Summary

- Formora makes validation timing explicit
- Each mode has a clear purpose
- `blur` is recommended for most real-world apps

Choose the mode that matches **user intent**, not just convenience.
