# Async validation (planned)

Async validation is a common requirement for real-world forms, such as:

- checking username or email availability
- validating coupon or promo codes
- verifying values against a server

However, **async validation is not supported in the current stable version of Formora**.

---

## Why async validation is hard

Async validation introduces several complex problems:

- results can resolve **out of order**
- stale responses can overwrite newer state
- loading indicators must stay consistent
- array operations (add / remove / reorder) can invalidate in-flight requests

Handling these cases correctly requires careful design.

---

## Current status

As of the current release:

- ❌ No `validateAsync`
- ❌ No `validating` meta state
- ❌ No debouncing support
- ❌ No async-safe field array handling

Formora intentionally avoids exposing a partial or unsafe async API.

---

## Roadmap

Async validation is planned for a future major release.

When introduced, it will:

- prevent stale async results from overwriting newer values
- work correctly with conditional fields
- behave safely inside field arrays
- expose a clear and minimal API

Until then, all validation in Formora is **synchronous**.

---

## What to do today

If you need async checks right now:

- perform them inside your submit handler
- or trigger them manually outside of Formora

This keeps your form behavior predictable and avoids race conditions.

---

## Summary

- Async validation is **not supported yet**
- Synchronous validation is the only supported model today
- A safe async API will be added in a future release

This page exists to set correct expectations and avoid confusion.
