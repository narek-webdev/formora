# Field Meta

Field meta describes **how a field has been interacted with**, not whether its value is valid.

Formora intentionally separates **meta state** from **validation** so UI behavior stays predictable, consistent, and easy to reason about.

---

## What is field meta?

Field meta answers questions like:

- Has the user interacted with this field?
- Has its value changed from the initial value?
- Is async validation currently running?

It does **not** decide whether a value is correct.

---

## Meta properties

### `touched`

`touched` becomes `true` when a field:

- loses focus (`blur`)
- is manually marked as touched

`touched` means _the user has interacted with the field_.

:::info
A touched field is **not necessarily invalid**.

---

### `dirty`

`dirty` indicates whether the current value differs from `initialValues`.

- comparison is value-based, not event-based
- works for nested paths (`profile.email`)
- works for arrays (`items.0.name`)

When array items are moved or reordered, **dirty state moves with the item**, not the index.

---

### `validating`

`validating` is `true` while async validation is in progress for a field.

This flag is cleared automatically when:

- the field value changes
- an array item is removed
- array indices are shifted (move / swap)

This prevents stale async UI states.

---

### `error`

`error` is a string produced by validation rules.

- errors exist only at leaf nodes
- errors may exist even if they are not visible yet

Validation decides **what** the error is — not **when** it is shown.

---

## Error visibility vs validation

Formora strictly separates two responsibilities:

| Responsibility  | Controlled by           |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| What is wrong   | validation rules        |
| When to show it | `shouldShowError(name)` |

This separation allows consistent UX across all validation modes.

```tsx
const meta = form.getFieldMeta("email");

if (form.shouldShowError("email")) {
  return <p>{meta.error}</p>;
}
```

You should **never** reimplement visibility rules manually.

---

## Summary

- Meta state describes user interaction, not correctness
- Validation produces errors
- `shouldShowError` controls UX timing
- Meta state stays aligned during array operations
