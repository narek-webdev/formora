# Formora

**Formora** is a tiny but powerful form engine for React, designed for **predictable validation**, **safe async handling**, and **complex real‑world forms**.

Formora focuses on _clarity and correctness_ instead of magic. Every behavior is explicit, testable, and easy to reason about.

---

## Why Formora?

Most forms fail not because of missing features, but because of **edge cases**:

- async validation results arriving out of order
- array fields shifting indices and breaking errors
- unclear UX rules for when errors should appear
- deeply nested values becoming hard to manage

Formora is built to handle these cases **by design**.

---

## Core concepts

### 🧭 Validation modes

Choose **one clear rule** for when validation happens:

- **`submit`** – validate only on submit (classic forms)
- **`change`** – validate on every change (live feedback)
- **`blur`** – validate when a field is left (best UX for most apps)

This is controlled by the `validateOn` option.

---

### 🔁 Safe async validation

Formora automatically protects you from **stale async results**.

If a value changes or an array item is removed, pending async validations are **invalidated**, so outdated results can never overwrite newer state.

---

### 🧩 Nested fields & paths

Formora treats field names as **paths**:

```ts
user.email
address.street
items.0.name
```

This makes nested objects and arrays first‑class citizens, without special APIs.

---

### 📦 Field arrays done right

Dynamic lists are hard. Formora handles them correctly:

- append / remove / insert / replace
- move / swap
- errors, touched, dirty, validating **move with the item**

No orphaned errors. No broken indices.

- 👉 **[Getting Started](./getting-started)** – install and build your first form
- 👉 **[Validation Modes](./concepts/validate-on)** – understand submit / change / blur

## Philosophy

Formora prefers:

- explicit behavior over magic
- predictable state over hidden side effects
- correctness over convenience

If you value **control, clarity, and long‑term maintainability**, Formora is for you.
