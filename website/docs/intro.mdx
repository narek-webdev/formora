# ✨ Formora

**Formora** is a tiny, headless form state and validation engine for React, built for **predictable behavior**, **explicit rules**, and **real‑world forms**.

Formora focuses on _clarity and correctness_ instead of magic. Every behavior is explicit, testable, and easy to reason about.

---

## Why Formora?

Most form bugs don’t come from missing features — they come from **unclear behavior**:

- when exactly should validation run?
- why is this error still here?
- why did a field suddenly become dirty?
- why did removing a field break the form state?

Formora is built to make these rules **visible, predictable, and debuggable**.

---

## Core ideas

### 🧭 Explicit validation timing

You always know **when validation runs**. Choose one rule for the entire form:

- **`submit`** — validate only on submit (classic forms)
- **`change`** — validate on every change (live feedback)
- **`blur`** — validate when a field loses focus (great UX)

This is controlled by the `validateOn` option.

---

### 🧠 Synchronous, predictable validation

Formora validation is **synchronous** and explicit:

- validation functions return `string | undefined`
- no hidden async side effects
- no race conditions

This makes validation behavior easy to understand, test, and debug.

> Async validation is planned for a future release and will be documented separately.

---

### 🧩 Nested fields by default

Formora treats field names as **paths**, not flat strings:

```ts
user.email
profile.address.street
items.0.name
```

Nested objects and arrays work naturally, without special APIs.

---

### 📦 Real form state

Formora tracks form state you actually care about:

- **values** — current form data
- **errors** — validation errors
- **touched** — set on blur
- **dirty** — differs from initial values

These states are updated **consistently and predictably**, even when fields are added or removed.

---

### 🔁 Conditional fields that behave correctly

When a field is unmounted:

- its errors are cleared
- it no longer affects form state

No stale errors. No ghost values.

- 👉 **[Getting Started](./getting-started)** — install and build your first form
- 👉 **[Validation Modes](./concepts/validate-on)** — understand submit / change / blur
- 👉 **[Nested Fields](./guides/nested-fields)** — work with complex data safely
- 👉 **[API Reference](./api/useform)** — detailed hook and method docs

## Philosophy

Formora prefers:

- explicit behavior over magic
- predictable state over hidden side effects
- correctness over convenience

If you value **control, clarity, and long‑term maintainability**, Formora is built for you.
