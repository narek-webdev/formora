# Reset API

Formora provides explicit APIs to reset form state in a predictable way.

There are two related methods:

- `reset(options?)`
- `resetField(name, options?)`

These APIs affect **values** and **meta state** together.

---

## `reset(options?)`

Resets the entire form back to its initial state.

### Signature

```ts
reset(options?: ResetOptions): void
```

### Default behavior

Calling `reset()` with no options:

- restores `values` from `initialValues`
- clears `errors`
- clears `touched`
- clears `dirty`
- clears `validating`
- resets `submitCount`

This is equivalent to recreating the form from scratch.

---

### Reset options

Depending on your configuration, `ResetOptions` may include:

```ts
interface ResetOptions {
  keepErrors?: boolean;
  keepTouched?: boolean;
  keepDirty?: boolean;
  keepValidating?: boolean;
}
```

These options allow selective preservation of meta state while resetting values.

:::info
Use keep options sparingly. Preserving meta state after a reset can be confusing for users.

## `resetField(name, options?)`

Resets a single field or nested subtree.

### Signature

```ts
resetField(name: string, options?: ResetFieldOptions): void
```

Because field names are paths, `name` can refer to:

- a single field (`email`)
- a nested field (`profile.address.street`)
- a subtree (`profile.address`)

---

### Default behavior

Calling `resetField(name)` with no options:

- restores the field value from `initialValues`
- clears the field error
- clears `touched` for that field
- clears `dirty` for that field
- clears `validating` for that field

---

### Reset field options

```ts
interface ResetFieldOptions {
  keepError?: boolean;
  keepTouched?: boolean;
  keepDirty?: boolean;
  keepValidating?: boolean;
}
```

These options apply **only to the specified field path**.

---

## Async validation interaction

When a reset occurs:

- in-flight async validations are invalidated
- stale async results are ignored
- `validating` flags are cleared (unless preserved explicitly)

This prevents late async errors from reappearing after a reset.

---

## Examples

### Reset the entire form

```ts
form.reset();
```

### Reset but keep errors

```ts
form.reset({ keepErrors: true });
```

### Reset one nested field

```ts
form.resetField("profile.address.street");
```

### Reset one array item

```ts
form.resetField(`items.${index}`);
```

---

## Guarantees

- Reset operations are synchronous
- Values and meta state remain consistent
- Nested paths and arrays are handled correctly
- Async validation cannot leak stale results

---

## Summary

- `reset` restores the entire form
- `resetField` restores a single path or subtree
- keep options allow selective preservation of meta state
- async validation is safely invalidated
