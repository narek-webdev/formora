# Resetting Forms

Resetting is not just about values — it also affects errors and meta state.

Formora provides two reset APIs:

- `reset(options?)` – reset the entire form
- `resetField(name, options?)` – reset one field (or a nested subtree)

Both APIs restore values from `initialValues` and can optionally preserve parts of state.

---

## `reset()`

`reset()` restores the entire form back to `initialValues`.

```ts
form.reset();
```

### What `reset()` does by default

By default, `reset()`:

- resets `values` to `initialValues`
- clears `errors`
- clears `touched`
- clears `dirty`
- clears `validating`
- resets `submitCount`

This returns the form to a fresh state.

---

## `resetField(name)`

`resetField` resets a single field path.

```ts
form.resetField("email");
```

Because field names are paths, you can reset nested parts too:

```ts
form.resetField("profile");
form.resetField("profile.address.street");
```

### What `resetField()` does by default

By default, `resetField(name)`:

- resets the field value back to the initial value
- clears the field error
- clears `touched` for that field
- clears `dirty` for that field
- clears `validating` for that field

---

## Keep options

Sometimes you want to reset values but keep certain UI state.

Formora supports keep options (exact names depend on your API), but the concept is:

- keep errors
- keep touched
- keep dirty
- keep validating

### Example: reset but keep errors

```ts
form.reset({ keepErrors: true });
```

### Example: reset a field but keep touched

```ts
form.resetField("email", { keepTouched: true });
```

:::info
Use keep options sparingly. Resetting should usually return the form to a clean state.

## Recommended UI patterns

### Clear a form after successful submit

```tsx
<form
  onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(async (values) => {
    await save(values);
    form.reset();
  })}
>
  ...
</form>
```

### “Reset” button

```tsx
<button type="button" onClick={() => form.reset()}>
  Reset
</button>
```

### Reset one row in an array

```ts
form.resetField(`items.${index}`);
```

This restores the item to its original value (from `initialValues`).

---

## Notes for async validation

If a field is currently validating asynchronously, reset:

- clears its validating state
- invalidates in-flight async work

This prevents late async results from reintroducing errors after reset.

---

## Summary

- `reset()` restores the full form to `initialValues`
- `resetField(name)` resets a field or nested subtree
- keep options allow preserving selected state
- reset invalidates async work to prevent stale results
