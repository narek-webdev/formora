# Resetting forms

Resetting a form is not only about values — it also affects **errors** and **meta state**.

Formora provides a **single, explicit reset API** that resets the entire form in a predictable way.

---

## `reset()`

`reset()` restores the form back to its initial state.

```ts
form.reset();
```

---

## What `reset()` does

Calling `reset()` will:

- reset all values back to `initialValues`
- clear all validation errors
- clear `touched` state
- clear `dirty` state

After a reset, the form behaves as if it was freshly mounted.

---

## Example: reset after successful submit

A common pattern is to reset the form after a successful submit.

```tsx
<form
  onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(async (values) => {
    await save(values);
    form.reset();
  })}
>
  <button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>
```

---

## Example: manual reset button

You can also expose a reset button to the user.

```tsx
<button type="button" onClick={() => form.reset()}>
  Reset
</button>
```

---

## Resetting nested data

Because `reset()` restores the entire form to `initialValues`, all nested data is reset automatically.

```ts
// initialValues
{
  profile: {
    name: "",
    address: {
      street: "",
    },
  },
}

// after reset()
{
  profile: {
    name: "",
    address: {
      street: "",
    },
  },
}
```

There is currently **no per-field or partial reset API**.

---

## Common mistakes

:::warning
Do not try to manually clear parts of `form.values`, `form.errors`, or meta state.

Always use `reset()` to return the form to a clean state.
:::

## Summary

- `reset()` is the only reset API
- it resets values, errors, touched, and dirty state
- nested data is reset automatically
- partial or per-field resets are not supported yet

This explicit behavior keeps reset logic predictable and easy to reason about.
