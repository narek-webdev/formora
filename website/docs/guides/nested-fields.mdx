# Nested Fields

Real-world forms are rarely flat. They contain objects, groups, and nested data structures.

Formora supports **nested fields out of the box** by treating field names as **paths**.

---

## Field names as paths

In Formora, a field name is a path into your values object.

Examples:

```ts
email
profile.name
profile.address.street
items.0.name
```

There is no separate API for nested fields — the same `register` call works everywhere.

---

## Basic nested object example

```tsx
const form = useForm({
  initialValues: {
    profile: {
      name: "",
      address: {
        street: "",
        city: "",
      },
    },
  },
  validateOn: "blur",
});
```

Register nested fields using dot notation:

```tsx
<input {...form.register('profile.name')} />
<input {...form.register('profile.address.street')} />
<input {...form.register('profile.address.city')} />
```

Formora automatically reads and writes values at the correct depth.

---

## Validation for nested fields

Validation works exactly the same as for flat fields.

```tsx
<input
  {...form.register("profile.address.street", {
    validate: (value) => (!value ? "Street is required" : undefined),
  })}
/>
```

Errors are stored at the same nested path:

```ts
{
  profile: {
    address: {
      street: "Street is required";
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Error visibility

Use the same visibility rules for nested fields:

```tsx
{
  form.shouldShowError("profile.address.street") && (
    <p>{form.errors.profile?.address?.street}</p>
  );
}
```

Or use `getFieldMeta` for a safer access pattern.

---

## Nested objects with arrays

Nested paths can include arrays at any level:

```ts
users.0.profile.email
orders.2.items.1.name
```

This works seamlessly with **field array helpers**.

---

## Resetting nested fields

You can reset:

- the entire form
- a nested subtree
- a single nested field

```ts
form.resetField("profile.address");
form.resetField("profile.address.street");
```

Formora restores values from `initialValues` and clears meta state accordingly.

---

## Common mistakes to avoid

:::warning
Avoid mixing flat and nested state management.

Always access values and errors through paths or helpers, not ad-hoc state.
:::

---

## Summary

- Nested fields are handled via path-based names
- The same APIs work at any depth
- Validation and meta state follow the same paths
- Arrays and objects compose naturally

Formora lets you model your form data exactly as your backend expects it.
